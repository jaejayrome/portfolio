    period: "Aug 2025 - Present"
    bullets:
      - "<strong>Distributed Logging System:</strong> Contributed to implementing a <strong>distributed logging solution</strong> using <strong>Quickwit</strong> in Rust by integrating Bytedance's internal tools (ByteMQ and TOS)."
      - "<strong>Cloud-Native Infrastructure & GitOps:</strong> Developed a <strong>cloud-native</strong> solution migrating anonymous proxy cluster deployments from Ansible to Kubernetes, using <strong>Kustomize and Jinja2</strong> for automated template rendering and <strong>ArgoCD</strong> for automated deployments."
      - "<strong>Kubernetes Logging Initiative:</strong> Implemented a <strong>Kubernetes-wide logging pipeline</strong> using Vector's Agent and Aggregator Architecture to collect and process <strong>Kubernetes Logs</strong>, forwarding them to a <strong>Websocket</strong> Middleware, implemented with <strong>goroutines & channels </strong>."
      - "<strong>Observability & SRE:</strong> Integrated internal <strong>Prometheus scrape/push pipelines</strong> for metrics collection, refactored <strong>Grafana dashboards</strong> for simpler monitoring and performed live traffic migration monitoring and real-time troubleshooting."
      - "<strong>Infrastructure As Code:</strong> Delivered a <strong>dual-cloud proxy</strong> by coupling <strong>Terraform</strong> for automated resource provisioning with <strong>Ansible</strong> for seamless <strong>application delivery</strong> across providers."

  - company: "Govtech Singapore"
    role: "Software Engineer Intern"
    location: "Singapore"
    period: "Jan 2025 - Aug 2025"
    bullets:
      - "<strong>Cloud Infrastructure & Integration:</strong> Implemented a <strong>FastAPI proxy</strong> service enabling seamless cross-team API integration while implementing <strong>AWS infrastructure</strong> (VPC, IAM, ECS, ALB/NLB) via <strong>Terraform</strong> with integrated formatting and linting protocols to ensure code quality and consistency"
      - "<strong>Cost Optimisation:</strong> Used Python coroutines for <strong>concurrent log processing</strong> across multiple log groups/streams of Sagemaker functions using CloudWatch Insights queries to <strong>resolve timeout issues</strong>, reducing CloudWatch costs by <strong>20%</strong> and improving query performance by <strong>30%</strong> as compared to that via console."
      - "<strong>Scalability Improvements:</strong> Resolved performance bottlenecks caused by unexpected high demand in a <strong>multi-account AWS architecture</strong> by implementing solutions involving cross-account <strong>API Gateway</strong> invocations, decoupled <strong>SQS</strong> messaging, and the application of <strong>Lambda</strong> reserved concurrency to ensure system stability under peak loads."
      - "<strong>Backend Infrastructure:</strong> Architected the <strong>authentication layer</strong> by integrating <strong>AWS Cognito</strong> with a custom <strong>Lambda</strong> trigger to synchronise the user pool with a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database. Designed a robust solution for merging internal and third-party database schemas, resolving <strong>potential race conditions</strong> during schema writes. Implemented a <strong>CI/CD pipeline</strong> using <strong>Flyway</strong> to manage controlled, consistent database migrations."

  - company: "Beep Technologies"
    role: "Software Engineer Intern"
    location: "Singapore"
    period: "Dec 2023 - Jun 2024"
    bullets:
      - "<strong>Performance Enhancements:</strong> Improved the performance of Google Maps inside a White Label Progressive Web Application (PWA) by <strong>50%</strong> through employing the use of <strong>debouncing, superclustering</strong> and <strong>framer motion</strong> animations to reduce the lag caused by the rendering of thousands of EV charging stations inside the component."
      - "<strong>Feature Addition:</strong> Refactored the <strong>internal state machine</strong> on the frontend to handle custom business logic in order to incorporate the <strong>Anti-Idling feature</strong>, preventing EV users from hogging a parking lot after their charging session has ended. Improved UX for users through implementing a <strong>virtualized listview</strong> with <strong>infinite scrolling</strong> that would <strong>lazily fetch</strong> charging stations and their charging sessions."
      - "<strong>Mobile Development:</strong> Made UI Improvements using <strong>React Native</strong> to ensure the same UX for both Android and iOS users. Integrated Push Notifications using <strong>expo-notifications</strong> for a third-party client application with our own backend so as to allow users. Additionally, configured the middleware on the backend to enforce logouts after certain periods of inactivity."
